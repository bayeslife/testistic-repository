#  Testisic Repository 

Storage of Testistic Model into kafka queues

There are topics for different information entities (here)[./src/Config.js]

The repository supports 
- creating and reading topics
- producing and getting Projects,TestRuns,ProjectTestRun
- create a Consumer

## Thoughts
The UI needs to query for a batch of test results for each Epic.  
The query group can be the userid for the user who is doing the querying.
